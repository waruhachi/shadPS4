# General information

**shadPS4** is an early **PlayStation 4** emulator for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** written in C++.

If you encounter problems or have doubts, do not hesitate to look at the [**Quickstart**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/Quickstart/Quickstart.md).

To verify that a game works, you can look at [**shadPS4 Game Compatibility**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-game-compatibility).

To discuss shadPS4 development, suggest ideas or to ask for help, join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/bFJxfftGW6).

# Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> shadPS4 is early in development, don't expect a flawless experience.

Currently, the emulator successfully runs small games like [**Sonic Mania**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAHoNzhHyCU), [**Undertale**](https://youtu.be/5zIvdy65Ro4) and it can even run [**Bloodborne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC6s0avpQRE).

# Why

This project began as a fun project. Given our limited free time, it may take some time before shadPS4 can run more complex games, but we're committed to making small, regular updates.

# Building

## Windows

Check the build instructions for [**Windows**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-windows.md).

## Linux

Check the build instructions for [**Linux**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-linux.md).

## macOS

Check the build instructions for [**macOS**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-macos.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> macOS users need at least macOS 15 on Apple Silicon-based Mac devices and at least macOS 14 on Intel-based Mac devices.

# Debugging and reporting issues

For more information on how to test, debug and report issues with the emulator or games, read the [**Debugging documentation**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/Debugging/Debugging.md).

# Special Thanks

A few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:

- [**Panda3DS**](https://github.com/wheremyfoodat/Panda3DS): A multiplatform 3DS emulator from our co-author wheremyfoodat. They have been incredibly helpful in understanding and solving problems that came up from natively executing the x64 code of PS4 binaries

- [**fpPS4**](https://github.com/red-prig/fpPS4): The fpPS4 team has assisted massively with understanding some of the more complex parts of the PS4 operating system and libraries, by helping with reverse engineering work and research.

- **yuzu**: Our shader compiler has been designed with yuzu's Hades compiler as a blueprint. This allowed us to focus on the challenges of emulating a modern AMD GPU while having a high-quality optimizing shader compiler implementation as a base.

- [**hydra**](https://github.com/hydra-emu/hydra): A multisystem, multiplatform emulator (chip-8, GB, NES, N64) from Paris.
